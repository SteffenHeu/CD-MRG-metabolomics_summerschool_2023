This repository contains teaching material for the [3rd International Summer School on Non-Targeted Metabolomics Data Mining for Biomedical Research](https://en.ssi.dk/news/events/summer-school-on-non-targeted-metabolomics-data-mining-for-biomedical-research).

## Exercise

Non-invasive drug monitoring is desirable as it improves patient experience. Instead of relying on invasive blood draws drug pharmacokinetics and metabolism could for example be monitored through the skin. During the summer school, you will be working with a subset of the data published by [Panitchpakdi and collaborators (2022)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271794). The datasets consists of plasma and skin swabs (forearm, forehead and upper back) collected from healthy volunteers (n=7) over the course of 24 hours, who have been administered the antihistaminic diphenhydramine. Your task will be to investigate whether:

- Diphenhydramine and its metabolites can be detected in the skin and whether it exhibits similar pharmacokinetics as in plasma?
- You can observe other metabolites that exhibit interesting time trends in plasma and whether those metabolites can also be detected in the skin?
